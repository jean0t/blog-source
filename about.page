Salut, Ã§a va? I am a brazilian IT professional with love and care about what I do, mostly developing OS tools and web apps casually to make my life better and professionally to serve businesses.

I love to explore new concepts and to build my own things, it also means I need to know how to handle both the presentation and infrastructure to make my application running, if it is web, that is it. During this journey I experienced different areas, although not much in pentesting.

This blog is a way I share the knowledge I acquired and also to guarantee it doesn't stays only with me. I also have as one of my goals to share and make some techs more popular as Common Lisp and others...

If you want to contact me for my services, you are free to
